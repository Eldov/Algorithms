    "\n",
    "The trick with this one is start from bigger numbers and once the palindrome is  bigger than the product, we know the next palindrome will be smaller and the loop is broken. That is why the range is starting by \"end\", stopping at \"start\" with -1 as steps.  \n",
    "In my first try I had the code appending results to the \"palist\", but it starts from the smaller number so it is not as efficient."
