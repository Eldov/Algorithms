    "First we import the data from the .txt file (it is in the same folder).  \n",

    "We can also notice it is separated by \"\\n\", which is where each line ends.  \n",
    "The function receives the string content and split it using the \"\\n\" as separator and call it \"triangle\".  \n",
    "The result is a list of strings, each string corresponding to a number/group of numbers.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",

    " We also know that, apart from the first row, we will always sum the number right before the last one of that row, in other words row[-2], the n-1 number.  \n",
    " This way we iterate through the range of 0 to len(triangle)/total of rows always summing the n-1 number.  \n",
    " If i in the range is 0, we sum the last number of the row. if i is bigger than 0, we always get the n-1 number in that row where n is the last number index."
