    "If we want to go up the Fibonacci number that does not exceed 4 million, we need k < 4,000,000.  \n",
    "We also want the even numbers only.  \n",
    "So every step we get a new k, which is the sum of i and j, a new i that becomes j and a new j that becomes k.  \n",
    "The next step we do the same until k hits the 4,000,000 wall."
